This is your first R assignment. 

1) Click on the green "Clone or Download" button
2) Click "Download ZIP"

Open this once it downloads and open "project_1.R"

3) Save this script somewhere on your computer

Name it "LASTNAME_FIRSTINITITAL_project_1"

For instance, I would save this script as

There are some notes on the script for you to reference to help with the assignment. You can work with friends and ask questions.
